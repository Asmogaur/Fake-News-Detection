# Fake-News-Detection
Built a machine learning model using Naïve Bayes classifier to classify the news articles as fake or real on various news social platforms as given datasets.


1) Naïve Bayes Classifier:

Naïve Bayes is a conditional probability  model which can be used for labeling. The goal is  to find a way  to predict the  class variable  (B) using a  vector of  independent variables (A),  i.e., finding the  function f:  A-->B. In probability terms, the goal is to find P(B|A), i.e., the probability of B belonging to a certain class A. B is generally assumed to be a categorical variable with two or more discrete values. It is a mathematically simple way to include contributions of many factors in predicting the class of the next data instance in the testing set. The limitation of Naïve Bayes is that they assume that all features are not dependent on each other. The Naïve Bayes rule is based on the theorem formulated by Bayes:
