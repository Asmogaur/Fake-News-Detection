# Fake-News-Detection
Built a machine learning model using Naïve Bayes classifier to classify the news articles as fake or real on various news social platforms as given datasets.


1) Naïve Bayes Classifier:

Naïve Bayes is a conditional probability  model which can be used for labeling. The goal is  to find a way  to predict the  class variable  (B) using a  vector of  independent variables (A),  i.e., finding the  function f:  A-->B. In probability terms, the goal is to find P(B|A), i.e., the probability of B belonging to a certain class A. B is generally assumed to be a categorical variable with two or more discrete values.
